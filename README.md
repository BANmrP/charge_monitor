# charge_monitor
This project was created to monitor battery discharge. The application displays a notification when the laptop's battery level drops below 30, 20, and 10 percent. In addition to the code, the repository includes an .exe file that you simply need to run and wait for the laptop to discharge (to see the low battery notification).
